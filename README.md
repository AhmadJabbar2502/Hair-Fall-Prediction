# Hair Baldness â€” A Data Story

## Project Overview
This project explores datasets related to hair loss and its contributing factors, combining data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to tell a comprehensive story. The goal is to understand how **genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and behavioral factors** influence hair loss.

The project is structured as a **data story**:

1. **Data Provenance:** Explore the origin, context, and structure of the datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning & Missingness:** Handle missing values and standardize categorical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize feature distributions, correlations, and temporal trends.
4. **Insights & Modeling:** Identify key patterns and relationships driving hair loss.

Two main datasets are used:

- **Predict Hair Fall Dataset:** Contains survey-based lifestyle and demographic factors.
- **Luke Hair Loss Dataset:** Daily logs capturing hair condition, stress levels, sleep patterns, and more.

## Features

- Interactive visualizations using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**.
- Correlation heatmaps with customized color palettes.
- Bubble charts and 3D scatter plots to explore multi-variable relationships.
- Time-series analysis of hair loss trends.
- Insight cards highlighting key observations from the datasets.
